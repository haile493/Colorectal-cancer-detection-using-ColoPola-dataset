# Colorectal-cancer-detection-using-ColoPola-dataset

### Methods
We applied two models from scratch and two pretrained models (DenseNet121 and EfficientNetV2-m) to classify the colorectal cancer using the ColoPola dataset.

### ColoPola dataset
The dataset consists of 572 slices (specimens) with 20,592 images, 284 slices of which were designated as cancer samples and 288 as normal samples.
